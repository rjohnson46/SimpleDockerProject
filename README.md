# Simple Hello World Container Project

This is a project to display a simple **HELLO WORLD** page inside of a container.

## 📌 Instructions
Everything you need will be in the **"Instructions"** file in this GitHub repository. My goal was to make it super simple for anyone to follow the steps, so anyone should be able to re-create this.

There are instructions for setting this up on:
- **Ubuntu Linux**
- **Red Hat Linux**

## 🛠 Automated Setup
There are two files that will build the entire project from scratch using a Python script:
- `SimpleDockerProjectRH.py` → For **Red Hat Linux** (`RH`)
- `SimpleDockerProjectUB.py` → For **Ubuntu Linux** (`UB`)

These scripts replicate the setup using the commands outlined in the **"Instructions"** file.

## 🤝 Credits
I want to give credit to **[@devops__community](https://instagram.com/devops__community) on Instagram**. This was their project that I replicated, and about **90% of the code** used was theirs. Please consider giving them a follow!

⚠ **Note:** This script has **not been fully tested yet**. I will update this line once testing is complete.
