# Simple Docker Project
This is a Project to display a simple HELLO WORLD page inside of a Container 

Everything you need will be in the "Instructions" file in this Github Repo. My goal was to make it super duper simple for anyone to follow the steps. So anyone should be able to re-create this.
There are instructions for setting this up on Ubuntu Linux and instructions for setting this up on Red Hat Linux

There is file "SimpleDockerProjectRH.py" & "SimpleDockerProjectUB.py" that will build the whole project for you from Scratch that I made into a Python Script using the commands in the "Instructions" file.*
